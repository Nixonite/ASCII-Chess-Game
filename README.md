ASCII-Chess-Game
================
This is a C++ ascii chess game for two players.

Still needs:

Text color to differentiate white from black
Detection of pieces in between initial position and destination position for movements i.e. the program doesn't have functionality to check if pieces are in between the movement directions. 
Castling code
Check/Checkmate/Stalemate code
